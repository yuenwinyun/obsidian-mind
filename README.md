> **An Obsidian vault that makes Claude Code remember everything.** Start a session, talk about your day, and Claude handles the rest — notes, links, indexes, performance tracking. Every conversation builds on the last.

---

## 🔴 The Problem

Claude Code is powerful, but it forgets. Every session starts from zero — no context on your goals, your team, your patterns, your wins. You re-explain the same things. You lose decisions made three conversations ago. The knowledge never compounds.

## 🟢 The Solution

Give Claude a brain.

```
You: "start session"
Claude: *reads North Star, checks active projects, scans recent memories*
Claude: "You're working on Project Alpha, blocked on the BE contract.
         Last session you decided to split the coordinator. Your 1:1
         with your manager is tomorrow — review brief is ready."
```

---

## ⚡ See It In Action

**Morning kickoff:**

```bash
/standup
# → loads North Star, active projects, open tasks, recent git changes
# → "You have 2 active projects. The auth refactor is blocked on API contract.
#    Your 1:1 with Sarah is at 2pm — last time she flagged observability."
```

**Brain dump after a meeting:**

```bash
/dump Just had a 1:1 with Sarah. She's happy with the auth work but wants
us to add error monitoring before release. Also, Tom mentioned the cache
migration is deferred to Q2 — we decided to focus on the API contract first.
Decision: defer Redis migration. Win: Sarah praised the auth architecture.
```

```
→ Updated org/people/Sarah Chen.md with meeting context
→ Created work/1-1/Sarah 2026-03-26.md with key takeaways
→ Created Decision Record: "Defer Redis migration to Q2"
→ Added to perf/Brag Doc.md: "Auth architecture praised by manager"
→ Updated work/active/Auth Refactor.md with error monitoring task
```

**Incident response:**

```bash
/incident-capture https://slack.com/archives/C0INCIDENT/p123456
# → slack-archaeologist reads every message, thread, and profile
# → people-profiler creates notes for new people involved
# → Full timeline, root cause analysis, brag doc entry
```

**End of day:**

```
You: "wrap up"
# → verifies all notes have links
# → updates indexes
# → brag-spotter finds uncaptured wins
# → suggests improvements
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

**Folders group by purpose. Links group by meaning.** A note lives in one folder (its home) but links to many notes (its context). Claude maintains this graph — linking work notes to people, decisions, and competencies automatically. When review season arrives, the backlinks on each competency note are already the evidence trail. A note without links is a bug.

**Vault-first memory** keeps context across sessions and machines. All durable knowledge lives in `brain/` topic notes (git-tracked, Obsidian-browsable, linked). Claude Code's `MEMORY.md` (`~/.claude/`) is an auto-loaded index that points to vault locations — never the storage itself. This means memories survive machine changes and are part of the graph.

**Sessions have a designed lifecycle.** The `SessionStart` hook auto-injects your North Star goals, active projects, recent changes, open tasks, and the full vault file listing — Claude starts every session with context, not a blank slate. At the end, say "wrap up" and Claude runs `/wrap-up` — verifying notes, updating indexes, and spotting uncaptured wins. The 285-line `CLAUDE.md` governs everything in between: where to file things, how to link, when to split a note, what to do with decisions and incidents.

### Hooks

Five lifecycle hooks handle routing automatically:

| Hook | When | What |
|------|------|------|
| 🚀 SessionStart | On startup/resume | QMD re-index, inject North Star, active work, recent changes, tasks, file listing |
| 💬 UserPromptSubmit | Every message | Classifies content (decision, incident, win, 1:1, architecture, person) and injects routing hints |
| ✍️ PostToolUse | After writing `.md` | Validates frontmatter, checks for wikilinks, verifies folder placement |
| 💾 PreCompact | Before context compaction | Backs up session transcript to `thinking/session-logs/` |
| 🏁 Stop | End of session | Checklist: archive completed projects, update indexes, check orphans |

> [!TIP]
> You just talk. The hooks handle the routing.

---

## 📅 Daily Workflow

**Morning**: Run `/standup`. Claude loads your North Star, active projects, open tasks, and recent changes. You get a structured summary and suggested priorities.

**Throughout the day**: Talk naturally. Mention a decision you made, an incident that happened, a 1:1 you just had, a win you want to remember. The classification hook nudges Claude to file each piece correctly. For bigger brain dumps, use `/dump` and narrate everything at once.

**End of day**: Say "wrap up" and Claude invokes `/wrap-up` — verifies notes, updates indexes, checks links, spots uncaptured wins.

**Weekly**: Run `/weekly` for cross-session synthesis — North Star alignment, patterns, uncaptured wins, and next-week priorities. Run `/vault-audit` to catch orphan notes, broken links, and stale content.

**Review season**: Run `/review-brief manager` and get a structured review prep document with all the evidence already linked.

## 🛠️ Commands

Defined in `.claude/commands/`. Run them in any Claude Code session.

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/standup` | Morning kickoff — loads context, reviews yesterday, surfaces tasks, suggests priorities |
| `/dump` | Freeform capture — talk naturally about anything, Claude routes it all to the right notes |
| `/wrap-up` | Full session review — verify notes, indexes, links, suggest improvements |
| `/humanize` | Voice-calibrated editing — makes Claude-drafted text sound like you wrote it |
| `/weekly` | Weekly synthesis — cross-session patterns, North Star alignment, uncaptured wins |
| `/capture-1on1` | Capture a 1:1 meeting transcript into a structured vault note |
| `/incident-capture` | Capture an incident from Slack/channels into structured notes |
| `/slack-scan` | Deep scan Slack channels/DMs for evidence |
| `/peer-scan` | Deep scan a peer's GitHub PRs for review prep |
| `/review-brief` | Generate a review brief (manager or peer version) |
| `/self-review` | Write your self-assessment for review season — projects, competencies, principles |
| `/review-peer` | Write a peer review — projects, principles, performance summary |
| `/vault-audit` | Audit indexes, links, orphans, stale context |
| `/project-archive` | Move a completed project from active/ to archive/, update indexes |

## 🤖 Subagents

Specialized agents that run in isolated context windows. They handle heavy operations without polluting your main conversation.

| Agent | Purpose | Invoked by |
|-------|---------|------------|
| `brag-spotter` | Finds uncaptured wins and competency gaps | `/wrap-up`, `/weekly` |
| `context-loader` | Loads all vault context about a person, project, or concept | Direct |
| `cross-linker` | Finds missing wikilinks, orphans, broken backlinks | `/vault-audit` |
| `people-profiler` | Bulk creates/updates person notes from Slack profiles | `/incident-capture` |
| `review-prep` | Aggregates all performance evidence for a review period | `/review-brief` |
| `slack-archaeologist` | Full Slack reconstruction — every message, thread, profile | `/incident-capture` |
| `vault-librarian` | Deep vault maintenance — orphans, broken links, stale notes | `/vault-audit` |
| `review-fact-checker` | Verify every claim in a review draft against vault sources | `/self-review`, `/review-peer` |

> [!NOTE]
> Subagents are defined in `.claude/agents/`. You can add your own for domain-specific workflows.

## 📊 Performance Graph

The vault doubles as a performance tracking system:

1. **Competency notes** in `perf/competencies/` define your org's competency framework — one note per competency
2. **Work notes** link to competencies in their `## Related` section, annotated with what was demonstrated
3. **Backlinks accumulate automatically** — review prep becomes reading the backlinks panel on each competency note
4. **Brag Doc** aggregates wins per quarter with links to evidence notes
5. **`/peer-scan`** deep-scans a colleague's GitHub PRs and writes structured evidence to `perf/evidence/`
6. **`/review-brief`** generates a full review brief by aggregating everything: brag entries, decisions, incidents, competency evidence, and 1:1 feedback

> [!TIP]
> To get started: create competency notes from the template, then link your work notes to them as you go. The graph does the rest.

---

## 📋 Bases

The `bases/` folder contains database views that query your notes' frontmatter properties. They update automatically as notes change.

| Base | Shows |
|------|-------|
| Work Dashboard | Active projects filtered by quarter, grouped by status |
| Incidents | All incidents sorted by severity and date |
| People Directory | Everyone in `org/people/` with role, team |
| 1:1 History | All 1:1 notes sortable by person and date |
| Review Evidence | PR scans and evidence grouped by person and cycle |
| Competency Map | Competencies with evidence counts from backlinks |
| Templates | Quick access to all templates |

`Home.md` embeds these views, making it the vault's dashboard.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone this repo (or use it as a **GitHub template**)
2. Open the folder as an **Obsidian vault**
3. Enable the **Obsidian CLI** in Settings → General (requires Obsidian 1.12+)
4. Run **`claude`** in the vault directory
5. Fill in **`brain/North Star.md`** with your goals — this grounds every session
6. Start talking about work

### Optional: QMD Semantic Search

For semantic search across the vault (find "what did we decide about caching" even if the note is titled "Redis Migration ADR"):

```bash
npm install -g @tobilu/qmd
qmd collection add . --name vault --mask "**/*.md"
qmd context add qmd://vault "Engineer's work vault: projects, decisions, incidents, people, reviews, architecture"
qmd update && qmd embed
```

> [!NOTE]
> If QMD isn't installed, everything still works — Claude falls back to the Obsidian CLI and grep.

## 🎨 Customize It

This is a starting point. Adapt it to how you work:

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Your goals | `brain/North Star.md` — grounds every session |
| Your org | `org/` — add your manager, team, key collaborators |
| Your competencies | `perf/competencies/` — match your org's framework |
| Your tools | `.claude/commands/` — edit for your GitHub org, Slack workspace |
| Your conventions | `CLAUDE.md` — the operating manual, evolve it as you go |
| Your domain | Add folders, subagents in `.claude/agents/`, or classification rules in `.claude/scripts/` |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `CLAUDE.md` is the operating manual. When you change conventions, update it — Claude reads it every session.
