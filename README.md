> **An Obsidian vault that gives Codex a real memory system.** Start a session, talk about your day, and your coding agent can maintain notes, links, indexes, and performance evidence that compound over time.

---

## 🔴 The Problem

Codex and Claude Code are powerful, but the default session model is still ephemeral. Every session starts too cold — no context on your goals, your team, your patterns, your wins. You re-explain the same things. You lose decisions made three conversations ago. The knowledge never compounds.

## 🟢 The Solution

Give your agent a brain.

```
You: "start session"
Codex: *reads North Star, checks active projects, scans recent memories*
Codex: "You're working on Project Alpha, blocked on the BE contract.
        Last session you decided to split the coordinator. Your 1:1
        with your manager is tomorrow — review brief is ready."
```

---

## ⚡ See It In Action

<p align="center">
  <img src="obsidian-mind-demo.gif" alt="Obsidian Mind demo — standup and dump commands" width="800">
</p>

**Morning kickoff:**

```bash
/standup
# → loads North Star, active projects, open tasks, recent git changes
# → "You have 2 active projects. The auth refactor is blocked on API contract.
#    Your 1:1 with Sarah is at 2pm — last time she flagged observability."
```

**Brain dump after a meeting:**

```bash
/dump Just had a 1:1 with Sarah. She's happy with the auth work but wants
us to add error monitoring before release. Also, Tom mentioned the cache
migration is deferred to Q2 — we decided to focus on the API contract first.
Decision: defer Redis migration. Win: Sarah praised the auth architecture.
```

```
→ Updated org/people/Sarah Chen.md with meeting context
→ Created work/1-1/Sarah 2026-03-26.md with key takeaways
→ Created Decision Record: "Defer Redis migration to Q2"
→ Added to perf/Brag Doc.md: "Auth architecture praised by manager"
→ Updated work/active/Auth Refactor.md with error monitoring task
```

**Incident response:**

```bash
/incident-capture https://slack.com/archives/C0INCIDENT/p123456
# → slack-archaeologist reads every message, thread, and profile
# → people-profiler creates notes for new people involved
# → Full timeline, root cause analysis, brag doc entry
```

**End of day:**

```
You: "wrap up"
# → verifies all notes have links
# → updates indexes
# → brag-spotter finds uncaptured wins
# → suggests improvements
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone this repo (or use it as a **GitHub template**)
2. Open the folder as an **Obsidian vault**
3. Enable the **Obsidian CLI** in Settings → General (requires Obsidian 1.12+)
4. Run **`codex`** in the vault directory
   - Optional: run **`claude`** if you want the Claude-specific hooks and slash commands
5. Fill in **`brain/North Star.md`** with your goals — this grounds every session
6. Start talking about work

### Optional: QMD Semantic Search

For semantic search across the vault (find "what did we decide about caching" even if the note is titled "Redis Migration ADR"):

```bash
npm install -g @tobilu/qmd
qmd collection add . --name vault --mask "**/*.md"
qmd context add qmd://vault "Engineer's work vault: projects, decisions, incidents, people, reviews, architecture"
qmd update && qmd embed
```

> [!NOTE]
> If QMD isn't installed, everything still works — the agent falls back to the Obsidian CLI and grep.

---

## 📋 Requirements

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) 1.12+ (for CLI support)
- [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) or [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)
- Python 3 (for Claude hook scripts and template validation)
- Git (for version history)
- [QMD](https://github.com/tobi/qmd) (optional, for semantic search)

## ⚙️ How It Works

**Folders group by purpose. Links group by meaning.** A note lives in one folder (its home) but links to many notes (its context). Your agent maintains this graph — linking work notes to people, decisions, and competencies automatically. When review season arrives, the backlinks on each competency note are already the evidence trail. A note without links is a bug.

**Vault-first memory** keeps context across sessions and machines. All durable knowledge lives in `brain/` topic notes (git-tracked, Obsidian-browsable, linked). Codex reads `AGENTS.md` as the repo operating manual. OpenClaw uses `AGENTS.md` plus root workspace files like `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, and `MEMORY.md`. Claude Code uses `CLAUDE.md` plus hooks. In all cases, the vault is the source of truth.

**Sessions have a designed lifecycle.** Codex uses `AGENTS.md` plus reusable prompts in `.codex/prompts/` for the core daily workflows. OpenClaw uses the same vault conventions plus root workspace files for startup, memory, heartbeat, and tools. Claude Code still has the richer automatic runtime with hooks and slash commands in `.claude/`.

### Agent Runtimes

- **Codex** — repo-native `AGENTS.md` plus `.codex/prompts/standup.md`, `dump.md`, and `wrap-up.md`
- **OpenClaw** — `AGENTS.md` plus `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`, and `TOOLS.md`
- **Claude Code** — `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/commands/`, and automatic hooks

### Claude Hooks

Five lifecycle hooks handle routing automatically:

| Hook | When | What |
|------|------|------|
| 🚀 SessionStart | On startup/resume | QMD re-index, inject North Star, active work, recent changes, tasks, file listing |
| 💬 UserPromptSubmit | Every message | Classifies content (decision, incident, win, 1:1, architecture, person) and injects routing hints |
| ✍️ PostToolUse | After writing `.md` | Validates frontmatter, checks for wikilinks, verifies folder placement |
| 💾 PreCompact | Before context compaction | Backs up session transcript to `thinking/session-logs/` |
| 🏁 Stop | End of session | Checklist: archive completed projects, update indexes, check orphans |

> [!TIP]
> With Claude Code, the hooks handle routing automatically. With Codex, the equivalent workflows are explicit prompt files under `.codex/prompts/`.

---

## 📅 Daily Workflow

**Morning**: In Codex, point it at `.codex/prompts/standup.md`. In Claude Code, run `/standup`. Both paths load North Star, active projects, open tasks, and recent changes.

**Throughout the day**: Talk naturally. Mention a decision you made, an incident that happened, a 1:1 you just had, a win you want to remember. In Codex, use `.codex/prompts/dump.md` for larger captures. In Claude Code, the classification hook and `/dump` handle this automatically.

**End of day**: Ask Codex to follow `.codex/prompts/wrap-up.md`, or say "wrap up" in Claude Code and let `/wrap-up` run.

**Weekly**: Run `/weekly` for cross-session synthesis — North Star alignment, patterns, uncaptured wins, and next-week priorities. Run `/vault-audit` to catch orphan notes, broken links, and stale content.

**Review season**: Run `/review-brief manager` and get a structured review prep document with all the evidence already linked.

## 🛠️ Codex Prompt Library

Defined in `.codex/prompts/`. Use them in any Codex session.

| Prompt | What It Does |
|--------|---------------|
| `standup.md` | Morning kickoff — loads context, reviews yesterday, surfaces tasks, suggests priorities |
| `dump.md` | Freeform capture — routes an unstructured update into the right notes |
| `wrap-up.md` | End-of-session review — checks note quality, indexes, links, and next-step cleanup |

## 🛠️ Claude Commands

Defined in `.claude/commands/`. Run them in any Claude Code session.

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/standup` | Morning kickoff — loads context, reviews yesterday, surfaces tasks, suggests priorities |
| `/dump` | Freeform capture — talk naturally about anything, Claude routes it all to the right notes |
| `/wrap-up` | Full session review — verify notes, indexes, links, suggest improvements |
| `/humanize` | Voice-calibrated editing — makes Claude-drafted text sound like you wrote it |
| `/weekly` | Weekly synthesis — cross-session patterns, North Star alignment, uncaptured wins |
| `/capture-1on1` | Capture a 1:1 meeting transcript into a structured vault note |
| `/incident-capture` | Capture an incident from Slack/channels into structured notes |
| `/slack-scan` | Deep scan Slack channels/DMs for evidence |
| `/peer-scan` | Deep scan a peer's GitHub PRs for review prep |
| `/review-brief` | Generate a review brief (manager or peer version) |
| `/self-review` | Write your self-assessment for review season — projects, competencies, principles |
| `/review-peer` | Write a peer review — projects, principles, performance summary |
| `/vault-audit` | Audit indexes, links, orphans, stale context |
| `/vault-upgrade` | Import content from an existing vault — version detection, classification, migration |
| `/project-archive` | Move a completed project from active/ to archive/, update indexes |

---

## 🤖 Subagents

Specialized agents that run in isolated context windows. They handle heavy operations without polluting your main conversation.

| Agent | Purpose | Invoked by |
|-------|---------|------------|
| `brag-spotter` | Finds uncaptured wins and competency gaps | `/wrap-up`, `/weekly` |
| `context-loader` | Loads all vault context about a person, project, or concept | Direct |
| `cross-linker` | Finds missing wikilinks, orphans, broken backlinks | `/vault-audit` |
| `people-profiler` | Bulk creates/updates person notes from Slack profiles | `/incident-capture` |
| `review-prep` | Aggregates all performance evidence for a review period | `/review-brief` |
| `slack-archaeologist` | Full Slack reconstruction — every message, thread, profile | `/incident-capture` |
| `vault-librarian` | Deep vault maintenance — orphans, broken links, stale notes | `/vault-audit` |
| `review-fact-checker` | Verify every claim in a review draft against vault sources | `/self-review`, `/review-peer` |
| `vault-migrator` | Classify, transform, and migrate content from a source vault | `/vault-upgrade` |

> [!NOTE]
> Subagents are defined in `.claude/agents/`. You can add your own for domain-specific workflows.

## 📊 Performance Graph

The vault doubles as a performance tracking system:

1. **Competency notes** in `perf/competencies/` define your org's competency framework — one note per competency
2. **Work notes** link to competencies in their `## Related` section, annotated with what was demonstrated
3. **Backlinks accumulate automatically** — review prep becomes reading the backlinks panel on each competency note
4. **Brag Doc** aggregates wins per quarter with links to evidence notes
5. **`/peer-scan`** deep-scans a colleague's GitHub PRs and writes structured evidence to `perf/evidence/`
6. **`/review-brief`** generates a full review brief by aggregating everything: brag entries, decisions, incidents, competency evidence, and 1:1 feedback

> [!TIP]
> To get started: create competency notes from the template, then link your work notes to them as you go. The graph does the rest.

---

## 📋 Bases

The `bases/` folder contains database views that query your notes' frontmatter properties. They update automatically as notes change.

| Base | Shows |
|------|-------|
| Work Dashboard | Active projects filtered by quarter, grouped by status |
| Incidents | All incidents sorted by severity and date |
| People Directory | Everyone in `org/people/` with role, team |
| 1:1 History | All 1:1 notes sortable by person and date |
| Review Evidence | PR scans and evidence grouped by person and cycle |
| Competency Map | Competencies with evidence counts from backlinks |
| Templates | Quick access to all templates |

`Home.md` embeds these views, making it the vault's dashboard.

## 🔧 What's Included

### Obsidian Skills

[kepano/obsidian-skills](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-skills) pre-installed in `.claude/skills/`:

- **obsidian-markdown** — Obsidian-flavored markdown (wikilinks, embeds, callouts, properties)
- **obsidian-cli** — CLI commands for vault operations
- **obsidian-bases** — Database-style `.base` files
- **json-canvas** — Visual `.canvas` file creation
- **defuddle** — Web page to markdown extraction

### QMD Skill

A custom skill in `.claude/skills/qmd/` that teaches Claude to use [QMD](https://github.com/tobi/qmd) semantic search proactively — before reading files, before creating notes (to check for duplicates), and after creating notes (to find related content that should link to it).

---

## 🎨 Customize It

This is a starting point. Adapt it to how you work:

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| Your goals | `brain/North Star.md` — grounds every session |
| Your org | `org/` — add your manager, team, key collaborators |
| Your competencies | `perf/competencies/` — match your org's framework |
| Codex behavior | `AGENTS.md` — Codex operating manual |
| Codex workflows | `.codex/prompts/` — reusable standup, dump, and wrap-up prompts |
| OpenClaw behavior | `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`, `TOOLS.md` — workspace files for startup, memory, and maintenance |
| Your tools | `.claude/commands/` — edit for your GitHub org, Slack workspace |
| Your conventions | `CLAUDE.md` — the operating manual, evolve it as you go |
| Your domain | Add folders, subagents in `.claude/agents/`, or classification rules in `.claude/scripts/` |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `AGENTS.md` is the repo-level operating manual for Codex and OpenClaw. `CLAUDE.md` remains the Claude-specific manual. Keep all agent surfaces aligned with the vault conventions.

---

## 🔄 Upgrading

Already using an older version of obsidian-mind (or any Obsidian vault)? The `/vault-upgrade` command migrates your content into the latest template:

```bash
# 1. Clone the latest obsidian-mind
git clone https://github.com/breferrari/obsidian-mind.git ~/new-vault

# 2. Open it in your agent
cd ~/new-vault && codex
# or: claude

# 3. Run the upgrade pointing to your old vault
/vault-upgrade ~/my-old-vault
```

> [!NOTE]
> The full `vault-upgrade` automation remains Claude-first today. In Codex, use `AGENTS.md` plus `.claude/commands/vault-upgrade.md` as the workflow source if you want to run the migration manually.

Claude will:
1. **Detect** your vault version (v1–v3.2, or identify it as a non-obsidian-mind vault)
2. **Inventory** every file — classify as user content, scaffold, infrastructure, or uncategorized
3. **Present a migration plan** — you see exactly what will be copied, transformed, and skipped
4. **Execute** after your approval — transforms frontmatter, fixes wikilinks, rebuilds indexes
5. **Validate** — checks for orphans, broken links, missing frontmatter

Your old vault is **never modified**. Use `--dry-run` to preview the plan without executing.

> [!NOTE]
> Works with any Obsidian vault, not just obsidian-mind. For non-obsidian-mind vaults, Claude reads each note and classifies it semantically — routing work notes, people, incidents, 1:1s, and decisions to the right folders.
