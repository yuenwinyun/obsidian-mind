# Obsidian Mind

Personal Obsidian vault -- an external brain for work notes, decisions, performance tracking, and Claude context.

## Skills & Capabilities

This vault has [obsidian-skills](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-skills) installed in `.claude/skills/`. Follow these skill conventions:

- **obsidian-markdown**: Obsidian-flavored markdown -- wikilinks, embeds, callouts, properties. See `references/` for callout types, embed syntax, and property specs. Always prefer `[[wikilinks]]` over markdown links.
- **obsidian-cli**: CLI commands for vault operations when Obsidian is running. See CLI section below.
- **json-canvas**: Create `.canvas` files with nodes, edges, and visual layouts. See `references/EXAMPLES.md`.
- **obsidian-bases**: Create `.base` files with views, filters, and formulas. Bases core plugin is enabled. See `references/FUNCTIONS_REFERENCE.md`.
- **defuddle**: Extract clean markdown from web pages via `defuddle parse <url> --md`.

## Vault Structure

| Folder | Purpose | Key Files |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| `work/` | Work notes, project tracking | `Index.md` (MOC) |
| `perf/` | Performance reviews, brag doc | `Brag Doc.md`, `Review Template.md` |
| `perf/competencies/` | Atomic competency notes (link targets for work notes) | One note per competency |
| `claude/` | Claude-facing context | `Memories.md`, `Skills.md`, `North Star.md` |
| `thinking/` | Claude's scratchpad for drafts and reasoning | Named `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md` |
| `templates/` | Obsidian templates | `Work Note.md`, `Decision Record.md`, `Thinking Note.md`, `Competency Note.md` |

## Obsidian CLI

When Obsidian is running, prefer CLI over raw filesystem. It provides vault-aware search, backlink discovery, and property management. Fall back to filesystem when Obsidian is not running.

```bash
obsidian read file="Note Name"                    # Read a note
obsidian create name="Name" content="..." silent   # Create without opening
obsidian append file="Name" content="..."          # Append to note
obsidian search query="text" limit=10              # Vault-aware search
obsidian backlinks file="Name"                     # Discover connections
obsidian tags sort=count counts                    # List all tags
obsidian tasks daily todo                          # Open tasks
obsidian daily:read                                # Today's daily note
obsidian property:set name="status" value="done" file="Name"
obsidian orphans                                   # Unlinked notes
```

`file=` resolves like a wikilink (by name). `path=` for exact path from root. Use `silent` to prevent files from opening. Run `obsidian help` for full reference.

## Session Workflow

### Starting a Substantial Session

A SessionStart hook automatically injects the vault file listing into context. No need to run `ls` or `find` -- you already know what files exist.

1. Read `claude/North Star.md` -- ground suggestions in current goals
2. Check `work/Index.md` -- see active projects and recent notes
3. Scan `claude/Memories.md` -- relevant context for the task
4. `obsidian tasks daily todo` -- see pending items

### Ending a Substantial Session

Before wrapping up a session where meaningful work was done:

1. Update `work/Index.md` if new notes or decisions were created
2. Update `claude/Memories.md` with key learnings or decisions worth recalling
3. Update `perf/Brag Doc.md` if wins or impact were achieved
4. Offer to update `claude/North Star.md` if goals shifted or new focus emerged
5. Verify all new notes link to at least one existing note
6. If work demonstrates competencies, add competency links to the work note's `## Related`

Skip steps that don't apply. The goal is transferring durable knowledge from conversation to vault state.

### Thinking Workflow

Use `thinking/` for drafts, reasoning, and analysis before writing final notes. **Thinking notes are scratchpads, not storage.** They exist to help you reason — once the reasoning produces durable knowledge, promote it to proper notes and delete the scratchpad.

1. Create a thinking note: `thinking/YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-name.md`
2. Use the Thinking Note template
3. Reason through the problem, analyze options, draft content
4. Promote findings to atomic notes in the correct folder (not one monolith — one note per distinct concept)
5. Delete the thinking note — it served its purpose
6. If the thinking process itself is worth preserving (unusual), keep it but link to the promoted notes

### Creating Notes

1. **Always use YAML frontmatter** with at minimum `date`, `description` (~150 chars), `tags`, and type-specific fields.
2. **Use templates** from `templates/`. Fill `{{placeholders}}` with real values.
3. **Place files correctly**: work notes and decisions in `work/`, drafts in `thinking/`, perf content in `perf/`, competency notes in `perf/competencies/`, Claude context in `claude/`. Nothing in vault root except this file.
4. **Name files descriptively.** Use the note title as filename.

### Linking -- This Is Critical

**Graph principle**: This vault is a graph, not a wiki. A note's value comes from its connections, not its length. Link FROM evidence TO concepts -- never curate evidence lists inside concept notes. Let backlinks do the work.

**Atomicity rule**: Before writing any note, ask: "Does this cover multiple distinct concepts that could be separate nodes?" If a note would have 3+ independent sections that don't need each other to make sense, split into atomic notes that link to each other. A graph of small, connected nodes is more useful than a document with internal headings.

Note types have graph roles:
- **Evidence nodes** (work notes, decisions): add outbound links to concepts they demonstrate
- **Concept nodes** (competencies, patterns): stay definitional -- evidence arrives via backlinks
- **Index nodes** (Index, Brag Doc, Memories): actively curate links -- they're navigational

Every new note must link to at least one existing note. Proactively suggest connections.

- `[[Note Title]]` -- standard wikilink
- `[[Note Title|display text]]` -- aliased link
- `[[Note Title#Heading]]` -- deep link to section
- `![[Note Title]]` -- embed content inline
- `[[Note Title#^block-id]]` -- link to specific block

#### When to Link

- **Work note <-> Decision**: bidirectional links
- **Work note -> Competency**: in `## Related`, link to competencies demonstrated with a brief annotation (e.g., `[[Competency Name]] -- what was demonstrated`)
- **Brag Doc -> Work note**: every entry links to evidence
- **Brag Doc -> Competency**: in `#### Competency Evidence` per quarter, link both competency and evidence work note
- **Review Template -> Competency + Work note**: per-competency assessment row with evidence links
- **Memories -> Source**: every memory links to where it was learned
- **Skills -> Usage**: skills link to notes where used
- **Index -> Everything**: `work/Index.md` links to all work notes
- **Thinking -> Final note**: thinking notes link to what they feed into, and vice versa
- **North Star -> Projects**: active focus areas link to project work notes

### Maintaining Indexes

Update these when creating or archiving notes:

- **`work/Index.md`** -- add to Active Projects or Recent Notes, move completed to Archive, keep Decisions Log current
- **`claude/Memories.md`** -- add memories with links to source, remove outdated ones
- **`claude/Skills.md`** -- register vault-specific workflows (not obsidian-skills -- those are in `.claude/skills/`)
- **`perf/Brag Doc.md`** -- log wins with links to evidence, add new quarters as needed

### Decision Records

1. Create in `work/` using the Decision Record template
2. Link from the work note(s) that led to the decision
3. Add to the Decisions Log table in `work/Index.md`
4. If significant, note in `claude/Memories.md`

### Wins & Achievements

When significant work is completed, add to `perf/Brag Doc.md` with links to the work note(s). Categorize under Impact, Technical Growth, Collaboration, or Feedback.

## North Star

`claude/North Star.md` is a living document of goals and focus areas.

- **Read it** at the start of substantial sessions
- **Reference it** when suggesting priorities or trade-offs
- **Update it** when the user signals a shift in goals
- Both the user and Claude write to it

## Tags Convention

Use tags in frontmatter (not inline):

- **Type**: `work-note`, `decision`, `claude`, `perf`, `thinking`, `north-star`, `competency`
- **Index**: `index`, `moc`
- **Status** (frontmatter field): `active`, `completed`, `archived`, `proposed`, `accepted`, `deprecated`
- **Project**: as needed, e.g. `project/my-project`

## Two Memory Systems

| System | Location | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Claude Code memory** | `~/.claude/` | Auto-loaded. Workflow prefs, quick-recall. |
| **Vault memories** | `claude/Memories.md` | Part of the graph. Rich, linked knowledge. |

Claude Code memory for session-level preferences. Vault memories for knowledge that benefits from linking and Obsidian browsing.

## Rules

- Never modify `.obsidian/` config files unless explicitly asked.
- Preserve existing frontmatter when editing notes.
- Don't configure git hooks or auto-commit unless the user asks. Sync is handled outside Claude.
- When asked to "remember" something, write to `claude/Memories.md` with a link to context.
- Prefer Obsidian CLI over filesystem when Obsidian is running.
- Follow obsidian-skills conventions for all Obsidian file types.
- Always check for and suggest connections between notes.
- Every note must have a `description` field (~150 chars). Claude fills this automatically. Enables scanning without reading full contents.
